Our tenant has an infrequent problem in which clicking on a Word or Excel document in SharePoint Online will open the document in Edit mode instead of Reading View mode.  This is very confusing for our users, especially since it just randomly occurs without rhyme or reason.

I wrote a Chrome Extension that forces the browser to open the document in the Reading View mode.  Editors can then use: *Edit Document -> Edit in Browser* to edit documents.

I thought this might be useful to others in this sub.
